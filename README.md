## About

A community powered list of programs that work (and those that don't) on the Windows subsystem for Linux. The official Microsoft repository for filing bugs etc is located [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows). This repo complements the offical one by providing a quick reference for how well programs run.

Please feel free to contribute programs you have tested to the table below. If you need help with the markdown, please review [a primer](https://help.gamejolt.com/markdown)

To contribute, please make a Pull Request, I will merge if it looks good! If you have never made a pull request it is fast and easy, please check out the [Github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

Then add your program below!

If you need to add more details about a program then add a `+` symbol to its name and add it to the [Program_Details.md](Program_Details.md) file.

## Important Note
Because this list is community powered, the maintainer does not hold any responsibility for the accuracy of the contents of this repository. Your mileage _may_ vary.
